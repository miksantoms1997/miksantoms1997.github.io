    	<h1><b> Things that I am passionate about </h1></b>

        <H2> Finance</H2>
        <P> I am majoring in Finance because I am very passionate about it. Throughout the high school I struggled with subjects like Math or Statistics because I found them extremely borning, I did not see the purpose of solving them. That changed once I got into Finance, suddenly I realized that I can use it to my advantage and it is actually benefical. I am also very passionate about investing and analyzing securities.</P>

        <H2> Economics </H2>
        <P> Although I am only minoring in Economics, I find it just as interesting as Finance. Economics help me understand why everything works the way it does. It teaches how everything is basically correlated to Economy. I believe it is extremely crucial to study and understand the subject because it affects us all.

        <H2> Basketball </H2>
        <P> Basketball has been an absolute life-changer to me. Without it, I would not be a student at the University of Maine. It has opened so many doors to me that I will always be greatful for the oppurtunities the game has given me. I have travelled to 15+ countires, met thousands of new people and met my future wife because of basketball. I love the game and even after I am done playing, it will always have a special place in my heart.
