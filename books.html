    	<h1><b> Couple of my favorite books</h1></b>

    	<h2>Principles by Ray Dalio</h2>
    	<p> Ray Dalio is arguably the most succesful hedge fund founder and manager in the world. He made Bridgewater, the company he founder, one of the most succesful private companies in the whole world. Despite his success, he faced many set backs and failed badly many times before he found a way to turn his company around. In his book, he talks about the principles that he discovered throughout his life and how they helped him in work and his personal life. I believe that every person could take away something valuable from the book.

    	<h2><b> Who Moved My Cheese by Dr. Spencer Johnson </b></h2>
    	<p> Who Moved my cheese? is a simple parable that revals profound truth about change. In the story, the four main characters are faced with an unexpected change. While some of them were able to adapt quickly, others couldn't, always looking for an excuse or were simply afraid to do so. The unique thing about the book is that it could be read to very young children and it could be read by the adults that are working for serious corporations. Everyone can learn a lesson or two by reading a book that is no more than 50 pages long. </p>

    	<h2><b>The Making of an American Capitalist by Roger Lowenstein</b></h2>
    	<p> The Making of an American Capitalist is one of the heaviest books I have read in recent years. It is hard to read and understand because it involves many complicated and tricky terms that you constantly have to look up in order to understand what the author is talking about. It also requires some background knowledge of the U.S. history, knowledge of stock market, big corporations and influental people that existed in the past. The book itself focuses on Warren Buffett's life story, how he grew up and how he became the richest man in the world. This book is not for everyone though, but it is a book that heavily changed my perspective on many things.</p>
